<p>Chuck Norris can sit in the corner of a round room. Chuck Norris invented airplanes because he was tired of being
  the only person that could fly. Freddy Krueger has nightmares about Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris beats rock, paper,
  scissors. Cannon balls, tanks, super destroyers, exploding stars — I could go on. Chuck Norris doesn’t cheat
  death. He wins fair and square.</p>
